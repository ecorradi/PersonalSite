            	<h1>About Enrico</h1>
                <p>
                	Enrico has Business Development experience in multiple industries and countries. His work providing
                    services and manufacturing products gives him a good understanding of multiple functional areas, 
                    although he has a passion to strategically develop markets and sales.
					He is 100% believer in building and growing relationships to successfully strengthen brands 
                    both in mature and emerging markets.
				</p>
				<p>
                	Enrico has worked for publicly traded and privately held companies as well as having start-up 
                    experience.
                </p>
				<p>
                	Most recently he has worked at developing existing and new business in the motorcycle market through
                	marketing, racing support and sales initiatives.
				</p>
                <p>
					Previously, Enrico developed new business by marketing and establishing alliances to bring new products
                    to the imaging vertical market. Beforehand, he held responsibility to manage all operations and distribution
                    of imaging products in the Latin American countries.
				</p>
                <p>
					Enrico has a restless entrepreneurial spirit and approach to business learned by working in family-owned
                    companies: starting businesses and sharing his experience in classrooms are the expression of his entrepreneurial
                    spirit and his desire to learn how to always "do things better".
				</p>
                <p>
					Earlier in his life, Enrico has been a business consultant and an assistant to strategic financial controls
                    and he soon connected the importance of managing business processes while maintaining an analytic mindset.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having a healthy lifestyle and being fit is part of Enrico's day: from cycling, running, working-out, to
                    Bikram yoga....and when it comes to dining, the best restaurant in town is his kitchen!
